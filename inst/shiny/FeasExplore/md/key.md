This section shows the attrition of patients with respect to reported disease severity. Disease severity for hospitalized patients is classified according to the level of oxygen supplementation received:

**Receiving any oxygen therapy**
Any record of oxygen therapy during the qualifying inpatient visit. This may be recorded in the form of oxygen administered as a drug or as a procedure (including intubation, tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)). In many cases non-invasive oxygen therapy will not be recorded on the patient record.  

**Receiving intensive services**  
Any record of traceostomy, mechanical ventilation or ECMO during the qualifying inpatient visit.  

**Receiving ECMO**  
Any record of ECMO during the qualifying inpatient visit.
